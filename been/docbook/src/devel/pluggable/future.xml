		Here are some ideas that could be utilized in future development of 
		<glossterm>pluggable module</glossterm> framework: 
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>Improve <glossterm>Pluggable Module Manager</glossterm> so that it can handle also <glossterm baseform="pluggable module">pluggable
			modules</glossterm> written in another language than Java (e.g. in Jython). We didn't implement this because  
			we didn't have ideas of <glossterm>pluggable modules</glossterm> that would be easy to write let's say
			in Jython and unadequately hard to write in Java (this is not case of <glossterm>tasks</glossterm>).</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para><glossterm>Pluggable Module Manager</glossterm> (and BEEN as a whole) could be ported to 
			some dynamic module platform such as OSGi. It would probably make BEEN components a bit 
			more loosely coupled. Nevertheless, there is no proof for this claim and <glossterm>Pluggable Module Manager</glossterm>
			has now features that are more than satisfactory for our purposes. Next, this would 
			need repackaging of all BEEN to OSGi packages, that are incompatible with BEEN <filename>.bpk</filename> packages.</para></listitem>
