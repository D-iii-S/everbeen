	As you could see, BEEN's support for scripting is very powerful 
	tool that could radically speed up development of new tasks.
	When using scripts for a good purpose (which can be e.g. building binaries
	from sources), the resulting code is much shorter and simpler
	than it would be in Java. Of course, not every <glossterm>task</glossterm> can be written
	using shell scripting, but the way a shell script can interact 
	with BEEN environment will probably make shell scripting powerful
	enough to use shell scripts for many commons tasks. And in case shell
	scripting is not satisfactory for some kind of task, you can 
	always try to implement the same in Jython (that has almost the 
	same power as tasks written in Java but is still a scripting language).
