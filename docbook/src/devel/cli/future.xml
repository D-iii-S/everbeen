	<title>Future Plans</title>
	
	<para>As already mentioned, automatically generated and XML bound data structures should
	replace some of the current classes in the BEEN framework. This would make it possible to
	remove most of the data conversion code from CLI, making it faster and easier to maintain.</para>
	
	<para>The BEEN framework would use an interactive command shell instead of the current simple
	client. The interactive shell would remove the overhead of process creation and TCP connection
	handshake.</para>

	<para>All new components added to the BEEN framework in the future should have a CLI module
	implemented so that CLI can support their functionality. New components should be
	designed with XML bound data structures in mind, will make the implementation of CLI modules
	simple.</para>
