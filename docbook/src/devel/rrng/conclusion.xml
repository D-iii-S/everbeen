		<title>Replace Derby by another DBMS</title>
		<para>
		Because Derby's transaction support is flawed and heavy use of transactions
		can cause deadlocks and lock timeouts, in order to fully support transactions
		(if they are really needed) Derby might be replaced by another embeddable 
		Java database that supports MVCC. A candidate could be H2 database 
		(<uri>http://www.h2database.com/</uri>) that has MVCC, can be embedded and 
		and is written fully in Java. Nevertheless all the consequences of such 
		a change have to be evaluated before changing anything.
