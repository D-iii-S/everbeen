Simple benchmark plugin test. <br />

This plugin runs 4 tasks: <br />
 
<p><b>Task 1</b>: gets the value of the task property "test.property". The value
is a String array with 2 elements, "Hello" and "World". It also sets a 
checkpoint with the name "data" and with a String array as value, with "BEEN"
and "DSRG" elements.</p>
 
<p><b>Task 2</b>: Starts after the first task successfully finishes. It gets the 
value of the checkpoint "data", which was set by the first task. It also 
sleeps for a the time which was set by the user in the experiment 
configuration.</p>

<p><b>Task 3</b>: Starts after the second task. It sets a checkpoint with the 
name "go" and with a String array as value, with "BEEN" and "DSRG" elements.</p>

<p><b>Task 4</b>: Starts immediately, and blocks on the "go" checkpoint which
will be set by the third task.</p>
