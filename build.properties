# If set to a path to some directory, we copy all packages from the directory to
# the /data/softwarerepository directory. This is useful to automatically get
# additional packages to the Software Repository (e.g. data packages for
# benchmarks) which aren't stored in the BEEN source tree. Software Repository 
# copies the packages to it's data directory on start-up. Needs to be disabled for 
# running the functional tests.
