* Benchmark Manager
    * Identify contexts running inside a benchmark
    * Storage information (in which db should results be stored, etc.)
    * "Benchmark ID", BenchmarkEntry in a separate HC map

        class BenchmarkEntry {
            String benchmarkTaskId;
            Map<String, String> storage;
            List<String> containedContextIds;
        }
