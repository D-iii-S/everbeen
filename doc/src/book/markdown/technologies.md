## Used technologies
The reasoning why we chose this or that tech is already done in the decision timeline, this should be more of a list of all the stuff we used and what we used it for (including the technologies that have no real repercussions on the project but we just needed them). Consider a table with a lot of fancy logos...

* 0MQ (inter-process and inter-thread (duh!!!) comm)
* Apache Maven (everything!)
* Apache exec thing (I don't even know how it's called) (spawning task JVMs)
* Apache commons (virtually everything around IO and compression)
* Apache HTTP Core/Components (HTTP server)
* Bootstrap (cool skins, save time)
* Hazelcast (cluster mayhem)
* Jackson (JSON serialization for inter-process data transport and user type abstraction)
* JAXB (serializable POJO generation)
* Logback (logging impl)
* MongoDB (store all kinds of stuff)
* SLF4J (logging unification of custom logging implementations and standard libraries)
* Tapestry (deploy the webapp)
* ...
* I definitely forgot about a half of these, feel free to complete this, just maintain the cool alphabetic ordering
