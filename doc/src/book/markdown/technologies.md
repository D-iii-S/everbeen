## Used technologies
The reasoning why we chose this or that tech is already done in the decision timeline, this should be more of a list of all the stuff we used and what we used it for (including the technologies that have no real repercussions on the project but we just needed them). Consider a table with a lot of fancy logos...

### <a id="devel.techno.maven">Apache Maven</a>
### <a id="devel.techno.exec">Apache Commons Exec</a>
### <a id="devel.techno.commons">Apache Commons</a>

### <a id="devel.techno.http">Apache HTTP Core/Components</a>

*  (HTTP server)

### <a id="devel.techno.bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>

### <a id="devel.techno.hazelcast">Hazelcast</a>
### <a id="devel.techno.zmq">0MQ</a>
